                <p>Carpe Diem, a latin phrase, which literally means to seize the day. These two words have been my
                    mantra
                    to
                    live life to fullest. Works like an amulet. Which, by the way, derived from a latin word called
                    'amuletum'.
                    So anyway, thanks for hearing me out through these texts. I appereciate your time and efforts. Have
                    a
                    wonderful life ahead. </p>

                <h2>Dedicating a Song!</h2>
                <h3>The song for today is Linkin Park's Leave Out All The Rest.</h3>
                <p>I dreamed I was missing. You were so scared. But no one would listen. Cause no one else cared. After
                    my
                    dreaming. I woke with this fear. What am I leaving when I'm done here? So, if you're asking me, I
                    want
                    you to know. When my time comes. Forget the wrong that I've done. Help me leave behind some reasons
                    to
                    be missed. And don't resent me. And when you're feeling empty, keep me in your memory. And leave out
                    all
                    the rest!</p><br>
